# mistekko-essentials

## List of things I've got in this repo:
* Emacs
  * Not the whole installation, but my entire user directory
  * don't worry, I removed the somewhat sensitive information\
* some scripts to make things more convenient
  * em is a shortcut for connecting to an emacs server or creating a new one if there isn't one running
  * ytd is just like yt-dlp, only it's easier to type and downloads things directly to my videos folder regardless of where it's run from
  * ytd-l is a shortcut script for downloading playlists
